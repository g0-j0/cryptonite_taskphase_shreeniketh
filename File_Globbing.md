# File Globbing

Globbing is a way to type files without needing to go through the entire path.

## Matching with *
```*``` basically acts as a fill-in-the-blank, where the * character can be replaced by any character. An example is if I run ```echo Look: file_*```, it prints out every single file starting with ```file_```.
```bash

```
