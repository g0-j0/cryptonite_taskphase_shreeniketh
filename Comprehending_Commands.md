# Comprehending Commands

## cat: not the pet, but the command!
The ```cat``` command reads the files out. It con***cat***enates the output of the files if multiple files are provided, hence giving us the name. Without any argument, it reads the terminal input and prints the output in the terminal itself. The syntax for the cat command is ```cat filename```. In this challenge, we run the command ```cat flag``` to get the flag for the challenge.
```bash
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{_}
```
